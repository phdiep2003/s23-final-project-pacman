My game will be based on Pacman (credit to Nintendo) and the Pacman characters. Hence, a lot of the features will be similar to the original Pacman. Rather than coming in one side and come out on the other side, the player will have to eat all the food before being transported to a whole new map (with new inky blinky algorithm) that he/she will have only 1 chance to win the game. If failed to survive, game over. If the player wish to continue, they have to play from round 1. Spoiler alert: There will be 3 maps in total.

How to play:

- Use arrows "Up,Down,Right,Left" to move the character
- When you hit a wall, you can not move into the wall. 
- When you eat all the Food, the gate will open to the next round. The gate will be closed until then
- You have three type of Mushroom: the purple will slow you down, the white one will speed you up, and the green one will give you an extra life
- The ghost will try to catch you. If they do, you will lose and lost the challenge
